As a junior engineer, I preferred doing things solo. It is so much fun to build things on your own without the need of communicating with anyone about anything. Ideal world! We devs love avoiding communication, don't we?

Progressing in my career, I realised I've been most productive, creative and gained expertise when I was around smart teammates. In order to get max benefit around them, you need to communicate well, better communication = better relationships. Before you start to communicate well you need to add more value to the team (or company). You are more valuable if you are:

1. Reliable: You can solve problems end-to-end i.e. research, prioritize, code, test, review, refactor.

2. Efficient: You can solve problems fast and perform better with time. You need to find more bugs, write better code, improve performance.

3. Impactful: You solve the most impactful problems.

4. Continuous learning: You read blogs, books etc. Connect with people in the space. Read and contribute to OSS projects.

After you become valuable, communication becomes easier but still needs effort. Here are few ways to help:

1. Friends: Don't make teammates; make friends. Not everyone will be same type of friend to you but try having banters, play games, party, go on a trip, discuss interests outside work etc.

2. Deadlines: You should avoid talking about deadlines since they are always missed. Yet sometimes you'd need to have deadlines to meet larger goals. Communicate freely without pressure to meet any expectations. Give a correct deadline based on your capability + buffer. If there's a knowledge gap, discuss it sooner rather than later. Speak up if you see signs of missing a deadline or if you think something else should take priority.

3. Proactive: Don't wait for your manager to tell you what to do. Identify problems and find solutions. Don't wait for your manager to ask about the status, be proactive in sending out periodic updates. If you don't know what to do poke your teammates/manager.

4. Compassion: Don't be like "someone not working the right way" or "someone not working enough". Try to help others if they need your support. Always communicate like you talk to family but be straightforward most of the times. Avoid rifts at all costs. Respect others choices and decisions.

5. Commitment: Be willing to go the extra mile to get the job done. It is perfectly fine to put in additional hours if required. Everyone in the team appreciates and respects you for it.

6. Patience: Relationship building takes time. Everybody prioritizes there work and life outside work. It's about consistent interaction, not forced connections.

Remember, the key to effective communication is openness, proactivity, and maintaining good relationships with all team members.

Even though you do all above and still cant make good communication and if you feel teammates are dumb, non-reciprocal, rude or boring.. Perhaps it's time to give them the boot. :smiling_imp:
