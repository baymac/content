As a junior engineer, I preferred doing things solo. It is so much fun to build things on your own without the need of communicating with anyone about anything. Ideal world! We devs love avoiding communication, dont we?

Progressing in my career, I realised I've been most productive, creative and gained expertise when I was around smart teammates. In order to get max benefit around them, you need to communicate well. You will be able to communicate well if you add more value to the team (or company). More value = honesty.

1. Friends: Dont make teammates; make friends. Not everyone will be same type of friend to you but try having banters, play games, smoke up, go on a trip etc. In my recent 3 weeks trip to Minswap Office in Vietnam I did all of it and much more. I cannot tell enough how much fun it is if your teammates are also your friends.

2. Deadlines: You should avoid talking about deadlines since they are always missed. Yet sometimes you'd need to have deadlines to meet larger goals. Communicate freely without pressure to meet any expectations. Give a correct deadline based on your capability + buffer. If there's a knowledge gap, discuss it sooner rather than later. Speak up if you see signs of missing a deadline or if you think something else should take priority.

3. Proactive: Don't wait for your manager to tell you what to do. Identify problems and find solutions. Don't wait for your manager to ask about the status, be proactive in sending out periodic updates. If you dont know what to do poke your teammates/manager.

4. Compassion: Dont be like "someone not working the right way" or "someone not working enough". Try to help others if they need your support. Always communicate like you talk to family but be straightforward most of the times. Avoid rifts at all costs. Respect others choices and decisions.

5. Commitment: Be willing to go the extra mile to get the job done. It is perfectly fine to put in additional hours if required. Everyone in the team appreciates and respects you for it.

6. Patience: Do not overemphasize building relationship. Everyone has a life outside work. Dont expect things to work a certain way. Replies or help may come delayed over slack. Do not be emotional about it. Just enjoy work and be good at it, relationships will build with persistency and better communications.

Remember, the key to effective communication is openness, proactivity, and maintaining good relationships with all team members.

Even though you do all above and still cant make good communication and if you feel teammates are dumb, nonreciprocal, rude or boring.. Perhaps it's time to give them the boot. :smiling_imp:
